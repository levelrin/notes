## Git

You submitted a pull request and noticed that your branch is outdated. How would you update it, assuming that there is no conflicting file?

You deleted bunch of files in local. Later, you realize that you want to restore some of those files but not all of them. How would you do it?

You have a configuration file for your development setup. It has a local path to the SDK.
You realized that git should ignore the configuration file because the local path varies.
So, you added the configuration file path in the `.gitignore`.
However, you noticed that it didn't have any effect. Why is that? And how would you solve this problem?

You ran `git status` and discovered that some files you were unaware of had been changed.
You just want to discard all the changes and make the working tree clean.
What would you do?

## Networking

You want to `ssh` into your coworker's remote environment, such as the AWS ec2 instance.
However, you got a permission denied error.
How would you solve this?

## Linux

You tried to send a file to your remote server using the `scp` command but failed because you do not have permission to write to that directory.
What would you do?

You ran `apt install curl` on a Linux machine based on RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux).
However, you got the "command not found" error.
What would you do?
