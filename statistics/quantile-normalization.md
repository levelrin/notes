It's usually used when we want to compare samples with various scales.

For example, let's say we have the test scores for Math, English, and Science.

For Math, the scores range from 50 to 95.<br>
For English, the scores range from 60 to 90.<br>
For Science, the scores range from 55 to 100.

It might be difficult to figure out the student's performance across the subjects fairly because each subject has a different range.

The quantile normalization makes the samples at the same range while preserving the orders.
