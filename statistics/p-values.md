The `p-value` tells us how confident we should be that group A is different from group B.

---

The p-value is a number between 0 and 1.

The closer to 0, the more confident we are.

---

How confident should we be?

A commonly used threshold is 0.05.

It means only 5% would result in a wrong conclusion.

---

Getting a small p-value when there is no difference between two groups is called a `false positive`.

Therefore, the p-value is the rate of false positives.

---

Trying to determine if two groups are the same or not is called `hypothesis testing`.

The `null hypothesis` means that the two groups are the same, which is the thing that we often want to reject.

The p-value helps us if we should reject the null hypothesis or not.

---

The p-value does not tell us how different the two groups are.

In other words, the p-value could be small even if the difference is small.
