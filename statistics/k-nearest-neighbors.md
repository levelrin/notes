It's for classifying data.

We put a sample (data point) into a category based on other samples' categories.

We need to decide how many near samples we want to consider by choosing the value of `K`.

For example, if K = 7, we will look for 7 nearest samples.

The decision is made by the majority.

Furthermore, we need to define what to do when a tie happens.
