`PCA` stands for `Principal Component Analysis`.

It's a way to understand datasets with multiple dimensions that are difficult to represent because it's hard to draw multi-dimensional graphs.

It's about plotting correlations among all samples into a 2D graph.

The main idea is to plot samples together based on their correlations.

In the graph, we can observe grouped samples and regard them as highly correlated samples.

The axes are ranked in order of importance.

For example, let's say the horizontal axis is more important than the vertical axis.

And we have clusters (groups) A, B, and C.

And let's denote the distance between A and B as AB, and they are vertically distanced.

Similarly, we have BC, and they are horizontally distanced.

If AB and BC are about the same, we say that B and C are more different from each other than A and B because the horizontal axis is more important.
